# ~8xx8 dotfiles

My dotfiles.

## Install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Andrew8xx8/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
PWD=~/.dotfiles rake install
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home
directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

## Thanks

These dotfiles forked from [akalyaev dotfiles](https://github.com/akalyaev/dotfiles) that heavily inspired by [holman does
dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).
